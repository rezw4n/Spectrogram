# Spectrogram

A program made with Python that transforms any spectrum of sound signal to visual representation of the sound frequencies.

The program uses Fast Fourier Transformation, which essentially decomposes a signal into a set of sinusoidal components of different frequencies.

Once the signal has been decomposed into its individual frequency components, the spectrogram then displays this information as a 2D image, with time on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and the intensity of each frequency component represented by the color or brightness of the corresponding pixel.

# Getting started

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/rezw4n/Spectrogram.git`

Move to the cloned repository `cd Spectrogram`

Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the Jupyter Lab by opening bash/terminal/powershell, type `jupyter lab` and hit enter.

Play around with the notebook!
